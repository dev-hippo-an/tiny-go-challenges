# Tiny Go Challenges

## The Goal
I've experienced a lot of trial and error while learning programming through books. 
Personally, the most effective method for learning programming was creating tiny challenging projects to simultaneously grasp concepts and usage.
In applying this approach to learning a new language like Go, the goal of this project is to enhance understanding of the Go language by creating various small projects.
